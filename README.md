This project is a Flappy Bird-style game implemented using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) in C++. The game involves a player-controlled bird navigating through a series of obstacles (pipes) while avoiding collisions. Key features and logic used in the game include:

1)Setup and Initialization: 
The game initializes various graphical elements such as the background, ground, player bird, and pipes using textures and sprites from asset files. The game window is created with a specified resolution and frame rate limit.

2)Game Mechanics: 
The main gameplay loop handles drawing the game elements, moving the ground and pipes to create an illusion of forward motion, and applying gravity to the bird. The bird's upward movement is controlled by pressing the space bar. Collision detection is implemented to check if the bird hits any pipes or the ground, which triggers the game-over state.

3)User Interface and Controls: 
The game starts when the player presses the Enter key, and the bird flaps its wings when the space bar is held down. Upon collision, a game-over screen is displayed, and the game can be restarted by pressing Enter again. Additionally, the game includes sound effects for bird flaps and textual instructions for the player.

This implementation demonstrates fundamental game development concepts such as sprite manipulation, collision detection, random number generation for obstacle placement, and handling user input.
